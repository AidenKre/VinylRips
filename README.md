# VinylRips
Takes the recordings of side A and B of a vinly and forms one full album, also splits the full album into the separate tracks

Open VinlyRip.Java

replace the final constant SIDE_A and SIDE_B with the respective file paths to the side A and side B recordings of your vinyl
replace the final constant COMBINED_NAME with the combined name you want the full album to be called
replace the final constant FILE_PATH with where you want the new tracks and the full album to be saved

figure out the time codes for the start of each track in the album

TIP: I go to youtube and search for a video called "full album <album name>" and check the description. Usually there it has the time codes and names for each song, if it is not there someone has probably commented it.
